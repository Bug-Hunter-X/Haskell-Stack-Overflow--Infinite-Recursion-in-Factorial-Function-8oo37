This Haskell code attempts to perform an infinite recursion, which will lead to a stack overflow error.

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)

main :: IO ()
main = print (factorial (-1))
```
The issue stems from the recursive call `factorial (n - 1)` when `n` is negative. The base case `n == 0` is never met, resulting in an infinite loop and a stack overflow error.  This is a common issue with recursive functions.
